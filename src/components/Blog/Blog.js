                    <h3> Why Choose Car</h3>
                    <p>
                        Cars can provide an element of freedom unlike any other method of transport, they allow you to go where you want, when you want. You’re not restricted by timetables and schedules, whether it’s a twenty-minute commute to work or an endless road trip, it’s in your hands.

                        Safety and security are two elements which are very important for many car users, not only do cars provide peace of mind, but they also offer an element of comfort that alternative travel methods simply cannot. Drivers can adjust their seat and steering wheel positioning along with having the ability to adjust the car’s temperature, making the comfort of the journey meet its optimal level.

                    <h3>Take A Ride On Motorcycle</h3>
                    <p>
                        No matter where you venture or how far you ride, when you’re on your motorcycle, you never feel like you’re commuting. You feel like you’re traveling. There’s a big distinction in there. Motorcycling is never about getting from A to B. Even if you’re going on a long weekend ride, you get the sense that you’re exploring, venturing out into the world, and discovering new things. And when you travel to another state or country, you’re taking things to a whole new level. In this post, we’re going to explore why it is that traveling on a motorcycle is not only enjoyable, it’s also smart.

                    <h3> On Your Own Time</h3>
                    <p>


                        There’s nothing more claustrophobic than traveling with a group, and heaven forbid, in a tourbus. It makes it impossible to take a detour, see the sights, or even have a break when you need one. Traveling on a motorcycle puts you on your own schedule, and your itinerary can shift at any time. Imagine taking a ride in the Italian hillsides and all of a sudden a cafe perched on a cliff comes into view. Pull over, man, and order a Peroni. Sit there for as long as you damn please, and pity those tourists who hear the whistle signifying that it’s time to get back on the bus.

                    <h3>Train Travel is Hassle Free</h3>
                    <p>
                        Forget waiting in long security lines. At the train station, you simply walk in and board your train. We didn’t have to walk through any body scanners, our luggage didn’t need to be x-rayed or searched. This means there’s no need to arrive hours before your departure time, like with airlines. In fact, on our first train trip, we hopped on board just as the doors were closing behind us!

                        It’s also much easier to pack for train travel than air travel. There are no limits on baggage weight, so you don’t have to worry about being hit with those pesky fees. This was good news for us because both Mike and I are notorious for over-packing. The standard amount of luggage allowed is two large items per person. There are also no restrictions on liquids, so bring as much shampoo as you want!

                    <h3>Flexibility Of Travelling By Train</h3>
                    <p>
                        Most trains don’t require you to make a reservation which means you can just show up, buy a ticket and get on board. There also is a lot of choice when it comes to departure times. Most destinations offer multiple trains a day, the most popular ones having at least one train an hour, if not more.
